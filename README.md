## Welcome to the Task Manager CRUD project!

This project is a task management application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. It is built using a variety of modern technologies, including PostgreSQL for the database, Next.js for the front-end and back-end, Semantic UI for styling, and pg-client for connecting to the database from Node.js.
